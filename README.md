# Mac & Windows TCO Calculator

Welcome to the Mac & Windows TCO calculator. You can use this tool to determine your Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Apple Mac and Windows end user computing devices such as laptops and desktops. The calculator considers a variety of costs that enterprises incur for Mac and Windows devices including:

> * Hardware costs
> * Operating system license
> * Device Management license (MDM)
> * Security agents
> * Productivity & collaboration software
> * Other core software
> * Internal engineering & support resources
> * External engineering & support resources

## Getting Started
Before jumping into the Excel spreadsheet, gather the data that you will need to enter in the tool. Talk to finance teams, vendor managers, or budget managers to determine your costs. While not mandatory, it's best practice to get this info in writing and keep evidence for future reference. 

## How to use this tool
Open the Excel spreadsheet "Mac and Windows TCO Calculator.xlsx". It is prepopulated with sample values.

On all orange tabs, replace all values in red font with your own values, or zero. All black text will update automatically. Do not edit any text in black font.

All green tabs will update automatically. Do not edit any text on green tabs. 

Green tabs illustrate your total 3-year and 4-year TCO.

## Who We Are 
This tool was designed by Rosalie Cook and Cisco's Device Experience team to calculate our own TCO for Mac & Windows. Including our past experience in analyzing TCO for previous employers, we have built device TCO calculators for 3 large enterprises with over 100K devices each. Now, we are sharing this tool with the community to help others do the same.
